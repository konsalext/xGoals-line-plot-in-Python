# expected goals line plot
Hello , in this repo i plotted an **xgoals difference line plot** for a team in the
Greek Superleague, using **6-week rolling average** with my data covering three seasons of football.
I tried to customize the layout to be similar to TheAthletic's xG plots , only difference they are using R and
here i am using Python.
There are four files : the three .xlsx files are the data and the .ipynb file is the notebook with the code !
