# xGoals-line-plot-in-Python
Hello , in this repo i plotted an xgoals difference line plot for a team in the
Greek Superleague, using 6-week rolling average with my data covering three seasons of football.
I tried to customize the layout to be similar to TheAthletic's xG plots , only difference they are using R and
here i am using Python
